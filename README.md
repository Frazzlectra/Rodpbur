Endless Runner
(The name was randomly generated)
I simply made an endless runner that increases speed over time. 
I made coins that give gold and others that take away gold. 
I also made barriers that when hit take health when health reaches zero the game is over. 
I made a start menu as well as a end screen. 
Player movement is controled with a nav mesh. 
Controls are a and d to move sideways and space or left mouse click to jump.
The different folders are differnt builds I just didn't want to lose anything. the unnumbered on is the latest.
